# Young-Persons-Primer
An LLM AR Game  inspired by the technology depicted in Neal Stephson's Sci-fi novel 'The Diamond Age'


Immediate goal is to encourage my son and others to learn the principles of Prompt engineering whilst mastering the skill myself.
Ambitious goal - use current LLM capabilities to emulate the 'Young Ladies illustrated primer' as envisioned in Neal Stephson's 'The Diamond Age'

Development goal is to make it 'deployable' by simply sharing the Root prompt.
